## Declaration

When it comes to **Honor Code**, albeit JI students are restrained by it, you don’t need to worry about it when copying and using the files in this repositories. **All of the materials** are not related to any solution to the problems and projects written by other students’ or me, and **all of the materials** are available on the Internet or Canvas.

:warning:For reminder, if you are a JI student and find any solutions to the homework or the projects,

- Copy the solutions and submit them. :x:
- Fully absorb the solutions and copy them. :x:
- Fully absorb the solutions and revise them. :x:
- Fully absorb the solutions and **write your own solutions**:grey_exclamation: :heavy_check_mark:

Moreover, the materials are owned by corresponding creators. The course slides and assignment files are owned by the instructors. The RC slides are owned by teaching assisstants. The reference textbooks are owned by their authors. The notes in reference folder are owned by me.



## Preface

This paragraph is specially for those JI freshmen. Since you have just already stepped into the university, A piece of idea may be useful to you.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
The people who teach you in university is usually called instructor or professor, instead of teacher, not because their skills are higher (even though it is true), but because they are not capable to teach well. They don't have the time to teach well. They don't have the will to teach will. They even don't have the ability to teach well. Therefore, don't expect the instructor can make everything clear, and learn everything by yourselves.

Moreover, some objective facts will be written in README files in the folders. Hope you can know more about the instructor and the course. The statements are strictly related on the time, the instructor and the course materials, so all the materials are just for reference.

## Introduction

This is a partial collection of materials for courses held by SJTU-UMJI. Since the materials are invisible to those who do not enroll the corresponding courses, this repositories collects materials for some of the courses, in order to help the students who want to have a look on them.

Again, the homework and the projects will be provided, but their solutions written by me or other students will not be offered in case of Honor Code violation. 



## Structure

The materials are categorized by course code. There are two version of course code, and currently many courses are changed to the new version. However, I will ALWAYS keep the old version.

- old — `V` + single category code + level number + unique number
- new — long category code + level number + unique number + version number + `J`

Some simple examples

- VE453 = ECE4530J
- VV256 = MATH2560J
- …

Moreover, some course has been updated, but they have almost equivalent materials.

- VG101 $\to$ VG151
- VP240 $\to$ VP250
- …

The contents in each repository mainly cover the following contents if exist:

- **README**: A README file to furtherly illustrate the course, maybe accompanied with some comments and advice.
- **Course Slides:** The slides used by the instructor to hold the lecture. 
- **Assignment:** The assignment given by the instructor, required to be finished by the due date.
- **Project:** Hard assignment provided by the instructor, required to be finished by the due date.
- **Lab**: Documents related to the lab section, required to be finished before or during the lab.
- **Reference:** The other materials related to the course.
- There may be some other folders containing different files varied from courses.

Because of the limitation of Github, one file cannot exceed the maximum size 25MB, so the file will be distributed into several zip files. You should download all the zip files and extract the ".zip" file. For convenience, if there are more files distributed in several sub-files, they will be loaded into seperated folders.



## Suggestions

- Please read the **course title** and **instructor** carefully, or you will be pumped into a totally wrong way.
- For **learning new knowledge**, files in **Course slides** or **Reference** give a comprehensive tutorial to the realm what you are searching for. 
- For **practicing your knowledge**, there are some problems in the files in **Course slides** and **Reference**. However, problems in **Assignment** is **not a good alternative** because no solutions will be provided, except the homework using the problems from the textbooks.

- **Assignment**, **Lab** and **Project** are prepared for those students who want to finish the assignments in advance. However, the assignment may be a little (or totally) different due to the update of the course.

- For those markdown files, using your own markdown previewer is recommended, since you cannot see math formulas on GitHub, or you need to download specialized plug-in.
