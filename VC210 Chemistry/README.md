# VC210 Chemistry

## Information

Instructor: Sun Huai & Bo Shouhang

Semester: 2018 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to buy the **code** for Sapling.

You’d better get the textbook for this course. *Chemical Principles* written by Peter Atkins.

The textbook is now uploaded in **Reference** folder. Due to the limitation of Github, it is distributed into three files. You should download all of them and extract the file ends with ".zip".

## Description

VC210 is a basic (useless) course in the university. It covers some basic theories in the realm of Chemistry.

All the homework will be delivered online, by a website called Sapling Learning. 

In this course, you have the rights to bring one cheating paper (CTPP or CP) to the exams. Usually, it is a double-sided A4 paper, with anything written by your own. You can take it as a reference when taking the exams. This means you don’t need to fully memorize a long formula to be faced with the exam.

## Tips

- In this course, learning based on the slides are better than learning based on the textbooks. The slides are more concentrated and useful.
- There may be some solutions to the homework online, but be sure that you can solve the problems by yourselves, or you will be slashed in the exams.
- Even though the exam allows a cheating paper, you at least should know: how and when to apply the knowledge; what is the content written on the cheating paper means; the whole process of solving a specific problem. A cheating paper is only an auxiliary weapon, and you are not expected to rely on the cheating paper much in the exam. Furthermore, writing a cheating paper benefits you to review the stuff comprehensively.
- If you are determined to choose ECE, keep in mind whether Chemistry is in your career.
