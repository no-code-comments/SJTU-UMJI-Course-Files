# VC211 Chemistry Lab

## Information

Instructor: Sun Ting

Semester: 2018 Spring

## Prerequisite

You need to be fully prepared for the huge workload.

Before every lab, you need to finish the pre-lab assignment, and read the manual carefully.

## Description

There will be three ugly lab courses, taking up you piles of time and is only worthy of 1 credit. In Chemistry Lab, it is more likely to be a tutorial of doing experiments and writing reports.

The lab time will hold on for 5 weeks, one experiment per week. At first, before the lab, you should **read the manual of the corresponding lab thoroughly** and **fully understand its concepts and procedures**. You are required to **finish the pre-lab assignment** and **finish writing the PLR(Pre-Lab Report, the report part before results and conclusions)**. TA will check your assignment and PLR during the lab. You will have a quiz before doing the experiment, and the content is about the knowledge written in the manual related to this experiment. 

After that, you should **do the experiment correctly** after the TA(or the instructor) showing a sample experiment. The most important thing is to **follow the rules in the lab** and to **record the data on your datasheet**. During the lab time, you should **finish all the experiment on time**, **record all the data** and **find the TA to sign on your datasheet.** 

You need to **complete all your report before the next lab section**, and **hand on it** to your TA.

## Tips

- There are some samples supplied by the instructor, but they get about 40 out of 50, not a very high score. So imitating its style will make you in a trouble.
- Asking others to get the reports with high score (about 48-50), and imitate the structure. You will find it easy to get higher score, even though completing a report is not easy.
- You’d better follow the tip above to improve your score. It is frustrated to put many efforts on the report and to get a bad feedback.
- Life get darker. Do not expect dawn.
- When it comes to whether longer reports get higher score, if it appears on the exam, the answer is no, or if it appears in real life, the answer is yes.
