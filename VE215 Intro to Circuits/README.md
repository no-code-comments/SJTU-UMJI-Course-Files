## Description

VE215 is a basic course for Electronics, and it is the prerequisite for VE216 and VE230.

It will cover the content about how to analyze the electric circuits.

The course also contains five lab sessions. You need to enroll all the lab on time. However, in this course, you do not need to keep as serious as VP141 and VP241 due to low requirements. You need to form a team before starting the lab by yourselves. This is only because the devices are limited, so one single person is also accepted in this lab.

- There will be no quiz.
- You can begin the lab as soon as you arrive. You can also be late for the lab.
- You can copy all parts before the Results part from the manual to your report.

There will be little tutorial for **PSpice** and other electronic drawing software. However, you need to be familiar with the software in that there will be some assignment related to it. A tutorial for **PSpice** performed by Zuheng Liu and a tutorial for **Multisim** has been uploaded in **Reference** folder.

## Tips

- The difficulty of exams can vary in a large range, depending on the difficulty of calculations.
- Most of the quizzes use the problems from the textbooks.
- “The problem is very easy. You can just use KCL and KVL to solve it.”
