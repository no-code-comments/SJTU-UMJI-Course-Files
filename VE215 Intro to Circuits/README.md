# VE215 Intro to Circuits

## Information

Instructor: Chen Sung-Liang

Semester: 2019 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to download an electronic drawing software. The instructor will supply the installer for **PSpice**. **Multisim** or other software are also acceptable, and you only need to select one.

## Description

VE215 is a basic course for Electronics, and it is the prerequisite for VE216 and VE230.

It will cover the content about how to analyze the electric circuits.

The course also contains five lab sessions. You need to . However, in this course, you do not need to be as serious as VP141 and VP241. You need to form a team before starting the lab by yourselves. This is only because the devices are limited, so one single person is also accepted in this lab.

- There will be no quiz.
- You can begin the lab as soon as you arrive. You can also be late for the lab.
- You can copy all parts before the Results part from the manual to your report.

There will be little tutorial for **PSpice** and other electronic drawing software. However, you need to be familiar with the software in that there will be some assignment related to it. A tutorial for **PSpice** performed by Zuheng Liu will be uploaded in **Reference** folder.

For practice, the solution after the textbook is far more enough since it will only give you the answer.

## Tips

- The first exam will be EXTREMELY EASY! The second exam will be PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT! For the second exam, there will be lots of calculations. Be fully prepared for the problems containing three wye-delta transformation or more.
- Most of the quizzes use the problems from the textbooks.
- “The problem is very easy. You can just use KCL and KVL to solve it.”
