# VE230 Electromagnetics

## Information

Instructor: Nana Liu

2020 Fall

## Prerequisite

You don’t need to prepare anything for this course in advance.

## Description

This is a course talking about electromagnetics. It will start from electric field, then to magnetic field, and end with Maxwell’s Equation, which links the electric field and magnetic field.

## Tips

- Albeit the homework doesn’t contribute to the grade, it will contribute to the total grade in another form.
- The course contains a lot of hard math knowledge without showing its principle. If you are interested in it, such as delta function, boundary value problems, method of images… and so forth, you can take VV557 before or after this course.
- Pratice delta function, Divergence Theorem and Stroke’s Theorem every day, because professor Liu favours them.
