# VE270 Intro to Logic Design

## Information

Instructor: Gang Zheng

Semester: 2020 Summer

## Prerequisite

You need to install **Multisim** and **Xilinx Vivado** for conducting labs during the course.

## Description

VE270 is a course teaching logic design. It will cover basic logic gates and combinational circuits. Moreover, techniques to design a small system for machines using logic gates and combinational circuits will be discussed.

You will need Multisim to perform lab 1 to lab 3, but contents related to **Multisim** will not appear in slides and exams. Verilog will be used to program the circuits, which is a C-like language, and you will practice it by doing lab 4 to lab 7.

Tutorials for installation and usage of **Multisim** and **Xilinx Vivado** is given in **Reference** folder.

## Tips

- **Multisim Professional** doesn’t have PLD Design. You need **Multisim Educational** instead.
- FPGA board cannot store the circuits. If you turn off the power, it will automatically delete all the works inside, so you need to program the device again.
- Using .bit file to program the device is very fast; nevertheless, it’s very slow to generate .bit file.
- **Multisim** cannot save .bit file, so it will be time-consuming to program the device every time.
- Verilog is a C-like language, but I don’t recommend you to understand it in the view of “programming language” but actually “circuits”. The logic of Verilog is slightly different from that of programs.
- Do your lab when you have other assignment!
