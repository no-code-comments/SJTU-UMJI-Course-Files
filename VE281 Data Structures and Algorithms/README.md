# VE281 Data Structures and Algorithms

## Information

Instructor: Hongyi Xin

Semester: 2020 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to have a C++ environment. (Linux OS is recommended)

## Description

VE281 is a course focus on algorithms and data structures. The course basically includes four parts: sorting algorithms, hash tables, trees, graphs. At the end of the semester, some programming methodology will be introduced.

## Tips

- Many algorithms have detailed explanations online, especially tree algorithms that can be visualized.
- For pseudo-code, the index usually starts at 1.
- The only advantage of delaying all the works to the last second is avoiding any loss caused by a sudden change on the requirement by the instructor.
