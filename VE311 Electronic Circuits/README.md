# VE311 Electronic Circuits

## Information

Instructor: Changching Tu

Semester: 2020 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to install both **PSpice** and **Proteus** for circuit simulation in this course.

## Description

VE311 is a course about electronic circuits, focusing on three types of electronic components: Diode, Bipolar Junction Transistor(BJT) and Field Effect Transistor(FET).

For the lab session, you need to use **Proteus** (**PSpice** for the fourth lab due to some software issues) to generate the simulation result. Then, you need to conduct experiments in the lab. However, the lab devices and components in the lab may be different from the handout, so you don’t need to strictly follow it. The final report should includes both simulation result and experimental result, but they are not necessarily related.

## Tips

- When you are stuck to the experiments in the lab, the best solution is always changing your devices and components.
- Don’t be cheated by the simplicity of the course slides and the assignment. Go to recitation classes to have the complete VE311.
