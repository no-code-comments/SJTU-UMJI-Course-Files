# VE453 Decision Making in Smart Cities

## Information

Instructor: Li Jin

2020 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to use a programming language (C++ / Python / Matlab / â€¦) to solve the homework.

## Description

This is a course generally introducing some concepts regarding smart cities, and covering some decisional problems. Problems of planning, control and optimization will be presented during this course.

Also, a final project is required in this course. The topic is open, and should be determined by each group, as long as it is related to the course contents.

## Tips

- Quiz can be viewed as open-book exams, so be fully prepared with those concepts, problems and corresponding solutions.
- Strictly follow the slides, because it is hard to find similar materials online.
- This is a rare course I have seen because its final grade is mainly dependant on the final project.
