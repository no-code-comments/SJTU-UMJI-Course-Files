    "- **Passing** (1-3 points): \n",
    "    - For a dataframe, computation is flawed or very simple. The conclusion doesn't fully address the question, but reasonable progress has been made toward answering it.\n",
    "    - For a visualization, a chart is produced but with some flaws such as bad encoding. The conclusion based on the visualization is incomplete but makes some sense.\n",
    "- **Unsatisfactory** (0 points): \n",
    "    - For a dataframe, no computation is performed, or the conclusion does not match what is computed at all.\n",
    "    - For a visualization, no chart is created, or a chart with completely wrong results.\n",
