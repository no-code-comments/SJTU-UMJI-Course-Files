# VE475 Introduction to Cryptography

## Information

Instructor: Manuel Charlemagne

2020 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to use C to finish the assignment program, with [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) installed in your system.

## Description

This is a course talking about cryptography. It covers a very large scope, from ancient cryptography such as Caesar cipher to modern cryptography such as SHA-256.

## Tips

- I am going to state that this course from Manuel is not so hardcore, but unfortunately this is the only one.
- It canâ€™t be said that math is important in this course. Math is almost all in this course.
- Put your effort on reviewing slides instead of trying challenges may drastically improve your expected grade.
- Work on the assignment as soon as possible. If you wait for Manuel, you will run out of time.
