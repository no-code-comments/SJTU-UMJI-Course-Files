## Tips

- Electronic answers should be submitted to JOJ with strict rules. Generally the file name should be `answer.txt`. Answers for one problem should be located at the same line, separated by comma without any space. There should be no new line at the end of the file.
- Be prepared of huge number of questions in the exams. Abandoning cheap but time-consuming questions is always a wisdom.
- Try to be very familiar with the algorithms for good grade.
- Near-at-hand is better than far-away, at least for the classes.
