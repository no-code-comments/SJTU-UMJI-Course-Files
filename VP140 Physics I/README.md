# VP140 Physics I

## Information

Instructor: Mateusz Krzyzosiak

Semester: 2018 Summer

## Prerequisite

You need to purchase the code for Mastering Physics, a website similar to Sapling Learning. 

## Description

VP140 is another fundamental course, mainly including dynamics. You are able to establish a model for a simple system and analyze its motion after learning this course.

There will be some assignment to be finished online through Mastering Physics. For one blank, you will only have three chances. Get pass in one time, 100 mark; get pass in two times, 97 mark; three times, 94 mark, or you will get absolutely 0. For a whole problem, if you get full mark, you may get bonus points, which means you get 100+ mark. So it is possible that you get full mark at last with some errors in the process, not like Chemistry.

There is a problem set in **Reference** folder, but problems in there are much more difficult than those you will solve in the exams. However, I find it effective to improve by reading a few problems in that book, so I give you one alternative when you are reviewing.

## Tips

- Many problems are similar to the problems in Physics Contest in high school.
- Much contents are related to Mathematics. Calculus is a pivotal tool in Physics.
- Some answers towards the assignment online are TOTALLY WRONG. See how many upvotes and downvotes and you will know whether the answer is correct. 
- I find an interesting method to distinguish problems with bonus points and problems without. If the problem has its own name, it has bonus points. If the title of the problem is “Problem 1.23”, it doesn’t contain any bonus point.
- One more time everyday! M·A·T·E·U·S·Z ! K·R·Z·Y·Z·O·S·I·A·K !
