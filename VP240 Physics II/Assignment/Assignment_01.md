# Assignment 1

(1) Calculate the electric field inside a uniform surface-charged sphere at any position in 3D (Hint: symmetry may reduce your calculation, try "solid angle", you need to do a surface integral, please don’t use Gauss’s law).

(2) Calculate the electric field inside a uniform volume-charged sphere at any position in 3D (please don’t use Gauss’s law, you can use the results from Problem 1).
