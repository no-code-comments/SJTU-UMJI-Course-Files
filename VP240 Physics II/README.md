# VP240 Physics II

## Information

Instructor: Wan Wenjie

Semester: 2019 Fall

## Prerequisite

You don’t need to prepare anything for this course in advance.

## Description

VP240 is the theory course in the realm of Physics. It mainly includes Electromagnetics. Some chapters in the textbook will not be covered in Wan’s course, and those contents are distributed in other courses like VE215, VE230…

The exam counts 80% of the final score, so please treat them seriously.

## Tips

- For the first exam, carefully read the slides, especially those examples without answers on the slides. For the second exam, carefully read the textbook and notice to abandon all of the slides.
- If you are a student major in ME or MSE, even though his course is a bit boring, but compared with MK’s, which will cover circuits (things taught in VE215, a course unavailable to ME / MSE sophomore) in the exam, Wan Wenjie may be your better choice.
- Many people strongly recommend others to take the lectures of MK’s course and the exams of Wan’s course.
