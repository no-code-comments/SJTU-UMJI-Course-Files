# VP241 Physics II

## Information

Instructor: Mateusz Krzyzosiak

Semester: 2019 Fall

## Prerequisite

You need to read the README file for VP141 first.

## Description

VP241 is the upgrade version of VP141, with five disgusting labs similar to Lab 3 in VP141.

All of the process is the same as VP141.

For Lab 2 to Lab 5, a good report is generally ranged in 20 pages to 30 pages.

## Tips

- The laboratory room is in a different place, so be careful.
- Bonus questions in VP241 are much less than bonus questions in VP141, so not many people can get full mark in in-lab session. However, less students raise their hands even if the question is simple. 
- Since the workload of VP241 is much bigger than VP141, and many people choose to start their reports before the due date, I want to remind you: the electronic version and the paper version should all be handed in before 15:00, or you will have a deduction.
- I give you the impetus to work harder: if you do well in this course, you can apply for the TA of VP241 later.
