## Information

Instructor: Liu Jing

Semester: 2018 Fall

## Prerequisite

You don’t need to prepare anything for this course.

The related materials is uploaded to the **Reference** folder.

## Description

This course is the basis of science, covering the techniques of limit, derivatives, integrations. Many courses later will use theses basic mathematics skills.

Unlike the other course, Honors Mathematics, **Honors Calculus** focuses on calculations and applications. It will not cover much theories, but need you to memorize many formulas and to apply them properly. If you are not good at Mathematics, or you haven’t learn Calculus before, I strongly recommend you not to select Honors Mathematics but to choose Honors Calculus, or you will forced to “learn” both two courses in order to apply calculations in other further courses.

When learning from this course, most of the cases you don’t need to fully understand a hard system of theories. The pivotal thing is to learn how to solve the problems. It doesn’t mean that you don’t need to know anything about the theories, or you will be at a loss when there is some changes.

Since Olga teaches VV156 now, the homework **with its solutions** both provided by the instructor is uploaded. You can take it as a reference to practice your skills. If you want to see more information about Olga, please reference **VV255** and **VV256**.

## Tips

- You do need to memorize a lot of formulas about derivatives, integrations and other concepts, including some complex but common formulas. Both instructors(Liu Jing and Olga) will put lots of calculations in the exams, so faster means higher score.
- Mathematics takes a lot of time.
- If you learn integration well, you will learn all mathematics courses later well. Take this course seriously.
- Exercising problems continuously is essential.
